# ScoLAD — Reproduction Package

**Sco**re-**L**evel fusion for logical and structural **A**nomaly **D**etection on MVTec LOCO AD.

Companion package for *ScoLAD: One Fused Score Detects Both Appearance Defects and Composition Errors in E-Commerce Fulfillment Inspection* (submitted to JTAER, special issue on AI-driven innovations in e-commerce). The setting is outbound (fulfillment) inspection of packed goods, where one fused score must flag both appearance defects and composition errors; numbers and claims are unchanged from the manuscript.

This repository exists so that the numbers in the paper can be **recomputed**, not taken on
trust. It ships the per-image anomaly scores that the reported results are built from.

**Main setting — image-level AUROC (L+S) = 0.9723 ± 0.0011** (seeds 42/43/44)
logical 0.9685 · structural 0.9762 · **+2.54 pp** over the same-harness SALAD reproduction (0.9469)

## 1. Verify in 30 seconds

The headline is recomputed from per-image scores alone. No 18 GB feature cache, no 9 GB of
checkpoints, no GPU — `numpy` and `scikit-learn` suffice.

```bash
python3 code/analysis/reproduce_from_package.py --pkg .
```

> **Windows**: the JSON artifacts contain Korean text, so run under UTF-8 —
> `set PYTHONUTF8=1` (or `python -X utf8 ...`). The scripts pass
> `encoding="utf-8"` explicitly, so this is a safety net rather than a requirement.
> File hashes in `MANIFEST.md` are computed on **LF** line endings; `.gitattributes`
> pins that, so a Windows clone with `core.autocrlf=true` still matches.

```
  seed 42: L+S 0.9721 (logical 0.9662 / structural 0.9780)
  seed 43: L+S 0.9714 (logical 0.9682 / structural 0.9745)
  seed 44: L+S 0.9735 (logical 0.9710 / structural 0.9759)

  3-seed L+S = 0.9723 ± 0.0011
    LS         reproduced 0.9723  paper 0.9723  diff 0.00001  PASS
    logical    reproduced 0.9685  paper 0.9685  diff 0.00005  PASS
    structural reproduced 0.9762  paper 0.9762  diff 0.00004  PASS
```

That script *is* the entire test-free protocol: z-normalise each branch score using the
mean and standard deviation of the **normal samples of the official validation split**,
sum with **equal weights (1,1,1)**, compute AUROC per defect type, and report
`L+S = (logical + structural) / 2`. No log scaling, no robust statistics, no clipping.

### Why ship scores rather than code alone

Re-training with the same code, the same pseudo-labels and the same seed **does not
reproduce the branch scores.** We measured this with a replicate run (same machine,
seed 42, independent re-training):

| what differs | Spearman |
|---|--:|
| seed only | 0.9381 |
| machine only | 0.9378 |
| **run only (nothing else)** | **0.9388** |

Changing nothing at all produces the same divergence as changing the seed and the machine.
The cause is `cudnn.benchmark = True` in `train_normal_unet.py`: convolution algorithms are
selected by wall-clock timing, and many of the selected kernels use `atomicAdd` in the
backward pass. The seed fixes **initialisation** — weights of a module that never runs are
bit-identical across runs — but it does not fix the **arithmetic**.

**The fused number does reproduce.** A branch-level gap of −0.0026 shrinks to −0.0007 after
fusion, which is 0.61× the seed standard deviation (0.0011). So the precise reproducibility
claim of this method is *"the fused number reproduces"*, not *"the branch scores reproduce"* —
and checking that requires the score files themselves.

Evidence: `results/tables/psad_variance_decomp.json`, `results/tables/psad_3way_compare.json`.

## Environment

The verification in §1 needs only Python 3 with `numpy` and `scikit-learn` (`requirements-verify.txt`).
The shipped scores were produced in a GPU container with a nightly build of PyTorch 2.11.0
(2.11.0.dev20260203, CUDA 12.8), timm 1.0.22, OpenCV 4.13.0 and scikit-learn 1.8.0 under Python 3.12,
on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU (32 GB); the branch scripts under `code/` assume that
environment plus the upstream implementations pinned in §8. The container's scikit-learn (with NumPy
2.4.2 → 2.5.3) was upgraded to 1.9.1 on 2026-09-13, after every shipped score had been produced; the
§1 verification prints identical output under both versions.

## 2. Method

A sum of three branch scores. Each catches a different failure mode.

| Branch | What it measures | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Reconstruction** — EfficientAD-S | local texture / structure deviation | `code/branches/reconstruction_ead/` |
| **Patch memory** — DINOv3-L L17 PatchCore | distance from the normal patch manifold | `code/branches/patch_memory_pc/` |
| **Composition** — PSAD-hc | component area histogram (h) + appearance embedding (c) | `code/branches/composition_psad/` |

Component labels for the composition branch come from a U-Net segmenter distilled from CSAD
pseudo-labels, with **two improvements**, both adopted on train/val evidence only:

- **Automatic merging of confusable class pairs** — pairs with
  `C[i,j] + C[j,i] > 0.10` in the confusion matrix between train pseudo-labels and U-Net
  predictions are merged. Across all five categories only `screw_bag c4↔c5` qualifies
  (0.168 / 0.261 / 0.142 over three seeds; the runner-up is ≤ 0.012 everywhere — a **10×**
  margin, so a single threshold isolates that pair without per-category hand-tuning).
- **Rotation TTA** — inference at four 90-degree rotations, which lie within the rotation range of the
  training augmentation, averaged.
  The rule "must reduce both the mean and the maximum of the validation-normal score tail"
  was applied identically to all five categories; only `screw_bag` passed.

## 4. What "test-free" means here

**No configuration was ever selected using the test split.** Decisions used two criteria only.

| Criterion | What it measures | Data |
|---|---|---|
| train discriminability | can the branch separate logical anomalies from normals | perturbations over train pseudo-labels + leave-one-out 1-NN AUROC |
| val stability | does z-normalisation survive outliers | max \|z_robust\| of the validation-normal score tail |

**The two can disagree.** A single validation-normal image that inflates the standard deviation
shrinks that branch's test z-scores across the board, effectively switching it off. Two
candidates were rejected for exactly this reason (k-NN with k=5; a cardinality distance).

**The highest-scoring candidate was also rejected.** An h:c weighting (w_c = 0.25) gave the
largest criterion improvement (+0.0150 mean), but because the criterion manipulates masks,
the area term changes directly while the appearance term changes only indirectly — so the
criterion **structurally underrates the appearance term**. A criterion cannot select on
something it cannot measure. Of 11 candidates, 2 were adopted and 9 rejected; the record is
in `results/diagnostics/PREREG_branch_improvement.md`.

> **Easy to misread**: `code/selection_criteria/soft_areas.py` iterates over the test split.
> That is *scoring*, not selection — that experiment (soft masks) was rejected on the
> validation tail (pushpins 1.77 → 10.03). Test AUROC is used only for the single final report.

## 5. What is not included, and why

| Item | Size | How to regenerate |
|---|--:|---|
| DINOv3-L feature cache | ~18 GB | `code/branches/patch_memory_pc_extra/I_dinov3_sl_cache.py` |
| U-Net segmenter checkpoints | ~9 GB | `code/branches/composition_psad/train_unet_seeds.sh` |
| EfficientAD training weights | ~2 GB | `code/branches/reconstruction_ead/train_ead_seeds.sh` |
| MVTec LOCO AD dataset | ~6 GB | from MVTec Software GmbH |
| DINOv3-L/16 weights | — | Hugging Face `facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m` (gated license; accept the terms, then download) |
| Rejected exploratory PSAD variants | — | flags in `score_psad.py` |

**Per-image scores are included**, because they are sufficient for the verification in §1.
The bulk items above are needed only to rebuild those scores from scratch — and, per §1,
rebuilding does not reproduce them exactly.

Not available: the human-annotation variant (5 categories × 3 seeds were never produced, so
the corresponding column was removed from the paper).

## 6. Paths

Scripts are shipped **exactly as they ran**, so the repository root is hardcoded in most of
them. Execution records were not edited after the fact. To retarget:

```bash
grep -rl /workspace/ai-vision-research . | xargs sed -i "s|/workspace/ai-vision-research|$PWD|g"
```

`code/analysis/reproduce_from_package.py` contains no absolute path and runs anywhere.
Details in `code/RETARGET.md`.

---

## 7. Integrity

`MANIFEST.md` lists every file with its origin path and SHA-256 prefix. `code/audit/` contains
the scripts that built and checked this package, including a coverage audit that extracts every
numeric value from the manuscript and confirms it is backed by an artifact here.

## License

MIT for our code and derived artifacts — see `LICENSE`. Third-party components (dataset, model
weights, upstream implementations) remain under their own licenses and are not redistributed;
they are listed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## 8. Upstream implementations

The reconstruction branch follows a public third-party reimplementation of EfficientAD (its README states
that it is unofficial), the composition branch follows PSAD's public implementation, and the component
pseudo-labels are those released in CSAD's official repository. Pinned commits (component names are
local folder names):

| Component | Repository | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| `efficient_ad_official` | https://github.com/nelson1425/EfficientAD.git | `fcab514` |
| `PSAD_official` | https://github.com/oopil/PSAD_logical_anomaly_detection.git | `1ae3146` |
| `CSAD_official` | https://github.com/Tokichan/CSAD.git | `d46cf85` |

Only derived artifacts are redistributed here; the upstream code and any model
weights must be obtained from those repositories.
